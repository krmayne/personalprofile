I am a single mother of 2 pre-teen children, one of which is autistic, I have come to study late in life in my mid 30’s to begin
pursuing an education I can use to further my careers prospects once my children are a little older. I only completed grade 10
 in my high school days, and have been a stay at home mother for 12 years so I have found this something of challenge. 
 I live in North Queensland and have in fact, never even left the state.  I love to play video games and you can find me reading
 (usually a fantasy series) at least once a day. Though I am not actually all that good at it I have found recently that I 
 really enjoy gardening and have started building a nice collection of Adenium species. I enjoy trying to grow new flower colours
 and styles.  My favourite adenium is the crispum. I am diabetic and while this definitely causes me to have off days I try to
 my best to get in and get everything done as best as I can. </p>
 
 <h1>Interest in IT </h1>
 <p>My interest in IT started at a very young age, my Grandfather began working with computers and teaching himself everything he wanted to know in the early 90’s.
 We were quite close and so I was often with him as he built a computer, or fixed them, or just experimented for his own learning. We had all the gaming systems growing
 up, starting with the Atari and the family often spent weekends out in our garage playing the latest games together. As I got older I began purchasing my own
 equipment and teaching myself how to build computers and fix problems, both software and hardware. My current PC was purchased nearly 14 years ago and has died 
 and been repaired many times by myself, it’s still going strong. I am fascinated with the concept of game design and coding and really enjoy reading the rise of
 small companies making amazing games. If those guys can do it, then maybe I can as well.</p>
<p>I chose this course through Open Universities Australia and the degree is offered through RMIT.  I didn’t specifically choose RMIT for myself or for any particular
 reason, it was the only university that offers this degree through OUA. I am liking this university however!</P>
<p>My expectations of learning in this degree is mostly on the coding aspects, in one form or another. I expect to learn basic IT skills such as designing websites
 and coding small software programs. I do think there will be a lot of theory to be learnt which will be very interesting to delve into what is happening within
 the IT world at any given moment, I do not expect there to be very much in the way of practical or physical learning, like building computers or other hardware, 
 simply because this is an online course. </P>
 
 <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
 https://www.seek.com.au/job/41083677?type=standout#searchRequestToken=57a77cba-f28f-4576-a67c-0052b546d0d6
 <img src="jobsnapshot.png" alt="Job Listing">
 <p> This position is for a mobile game developer, I find this one particularly interesting as I am quite interested in the gaming aspects of IT and would 
 definitely be interested in a position like this in the future. I would need to have prior experience designing and coding mobile games that were successfully 
 placed in the App and Play stores, using the Unity program. I would need to learn animation, specifically using C# as stated in the advertisement, and both of 
 those requirements would be better off being in 3D games or applications. I would need to learn what code versioning is, and how to use the tools required for 
 that, As well as an understating of “Native plug in architecture” for the two mobile operating systems.</p>
<p>I have none of these skills or experiences currently and have only one term of basic coding in java behind me.</p>
<p>In order to obtain these skills and qualifications my first step will be to complete my Bachelors of IT, I would like to look at following the course down a 
game development line but this is not currently offered so I would choose my minors based on which would give me the closest experience and skills that these 
jobs require. I will begin learning about C# animation on my own time, as well as learning about code versioning, and anything else that may help me to obtain 
these skills. I will also begin to learn how to use Unity. After graduation I could go one of two ways, I can attempt to design my own games and apps and try to 
gain the necessary commercial experience on my own, or I can search for an entry level position that will help me gain the necessary commercial experience 
working on mobile games that this position requires. </p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>Myers-Briggs: The results of my Myers-Briggs personality type, to the surprise of absolutely nobody who knows me, is Logician INTP. The basic aspects of this 
personality type is of a person who is quite logical, doesn’t use emotions as a basis for understanding or making decisions and is quite often a loner.  
You can read all about this personality type and how I interact with people <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality"> here</a><p>
<p>Learning styles test: I used personalitymax.com to perform a learning style test. My results were matching Visual and kinesthetics learning styles at 69% each 
and auditory my least preferred at 49%. This means that I learn best by doing and practicing, and by visual examples, and I don’t learn much at all simply listening. 
You can see more information <a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=69-46-69&name_key=4f0e9846f6">here </a></p>
<p>Big 5 personality test. I did this test at www.bigfive-test.com you can see my specific results using the code 5e7459e719324500084d274f on their website. 
I honestly do not agree with some of these results regarding me. I am not angry or self-conscious and this test has given me high scores for both, as well as 
scoring high in some aspects that I specifically picked as less applicable to myself. It has given me quite high scores in intelligence, creativity, morality and 
cooperation. </p>
<p>The results of these personality tests don’t have much impact on myself personally, I have known my Myers-Briggs personality type for several years and for the 
most part agree with what it says about me. I know that I am aloof and prefer solitude and that I don’t understand or agree with the way many people interact with 
the world. The big 5 personality test is new, however as stated in my passage above I am not so sure I agree with. Taken at face value the 2 tests conflict at times 
especially when it is considering emotions and I have to agree with Myers-Briggs on this one. The learning styles test was interesting and does align well with 
how I have come to understand my way of learning and understanding things through University. 

When it comes to teamwork I make sure that I am involved and working within the team. While I prefer to work alone I do recognise that I often can and do perform 
better work with some feedback and people to discuss ideas and bounce work off of. Others getting overly emotional or stressing can cause me difficulties but 
this is something I need to accept as my own block and try my best to help my teammates work through everything.
I don’t believe I would need to do much more than this when forming a team, regardless of different personalities we are all adults and should be able to find a 
way to work together even if our base personalities don’t mesh all that well. We have work to do and should be focussing on getting that work done together. 
The one thing I should be aware of is not dismissing others emotional needs in the team simply because I think they are unimportant to the task ahead, as that 
is not the case for many others and can come across as rude when it isn’t intended to be. </p>

<h1>IT Project Idea</h1>
<p>My project idea is of a small insertable device that can be used to obtain up to the minute health statistics of an individual either for their personal 
records, daily health maintenance or in the case of emergencies, accidents or community disasters. The vitals measured would be important information such as 
blood pressure, blood glucose levels, heart rate, temperature and oxygen levels. These could be accessed by use of a device or smart phone app and could replace 
manual measurements used daily in the home and during health check-ups and hospital visits. </P>
<p>The recent advancements in blood glucose monitoring devices has given me the idea to expand on this available technology and build a similar device that can 
be used to monitor more health statistics. This technology could be an incredible help for health care professionals and emergency personal. 
Being able to take immediate, accurate readings on the spot using one device already on the patient will mean much less time taking those readings manually 
which uses several different pieces of equipment, immediate notification if the patient is suffering from high or low readings and much less strain on the 
medical personal and equipment. It may also lower incidences of patients seeing doctors and attending emergency rooms for simple check-ups. </p>
<p>Having based this idea off the existing technology already in place for new glucose management devices this new medical device could be inserted in much the 
same way, these use a small thin fibre inserted into the patients arm, stomach or leg and measuring the medical symptoms of the person. 
This would measure the basics such as blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, blood glucose levels and oxygen levels. There is room for expansion of such a 
device for reading details such as creatin levels in kidney patients, iron levels, white blood cells in cancer patients and other illness specific readings. 
The readings themselves would be taken by passing a smart phone with an associated app installed or a specific device designed to output the readings taken from 
the device. The idea would be for those with the device to be able to self-monitor their own readings without constantly having to use other equipment such as 
blood glucose monitors and the use of lancets for finger pricking, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and other such at home equipment. 
Many patients having to treat or test themselves several times a day, every single day, for the rest of their lives often become complacent or annoyed with the 
constant daily care, which in turn results in a lower level of caring for themselves. I believe those people especially would find the one device, inserted once 
a week or month to be a preferred alternative. This would result in many people taking much better care of themselves which will help ease the strain on health 
systems, and lower incidences of complications resulting from inadequate care for themselves.
In the case of accidents or emergencies emergency personal or triage nurses could obtain immediate readings on the spot for individuals with such devices, this 
would help get people the care they need faster, and more efficiently and free up space and time in hospitals and emergency departments. Hospital ward rounds in 
general would be much faster, eliminating the need to wake up most patients to take vitals every hour, as most could be taken simply by using the device. 
There is more room for expansion with such a device by making them tailored to individuals, most likely by supplying the device on insertion with the patient’s 
important medical details such as blood type, allergies, known illnesses or autoimmune diseases, recent surgeries and other necessary or vital medical information.</p>

<p>The hardware for this device would be based on the already existing FreestyleLibre, https://www.freestylelibre.com.au/glucose-monitoring-system/sensor and 
it’s accompanying software. The hardware itself would need to be refined and rebuilt with more sensors and miniature devices capable of taking the readings that 
are needed and the software written to take those readings and output them in a way that makes sense for both those at home and medical personal. 
The software would need to be able to store data and track changes, show trends such as climbing blood pressure or temperatures and perhaps indicate when medical 
intervention might be required. The basic template for the hardware and software is already available and I believe the biggest hurdle to making such a device 
would be designing the hardware small enough, and capable of taking the readings for such a device. </p>

<p>If this idea was successful, I believe that it would see a massive increase in the amount of people with illnesses beginning to take care of themselves 
properly at home. Constantly needing to pull out equipment up to nine or ten times a day to take a single reading begins to get wearisome and having a single 
device already inserted and ready to be used at all times would make that aspect of home care much easier. I really do believe that this alone would make a huge 
difference to people taking better care of themselves and easing some of the burden on our health care systems. </p>
